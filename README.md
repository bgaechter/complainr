# Complainr #
Let your neighbours notify you if your party gets too loud.

## Setup ##
`HOST` env variable should be the path where complainr is server e.g. `http://www.somehost.com`

Current setup expects redis at localhost:6379 (Should be configured with ENV variable)

## TODOs ##
* Push instead of pull notification for complaints
* A lot of code cleanup...
